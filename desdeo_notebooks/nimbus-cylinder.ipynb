    "# Solving the cylinder problem using NIMBUS\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a cell shaped like a cylinder, that is, a circular cross-sectional prism. The shape of the cell is here determined by two quantities, its radius $x_1$ and its height $x_2$. We want to maximize the volume of the cylinder and minimize the surface area. In addition to this, cylinder's height should be close to 15 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "The volume of a cylinder is the product of its base area and height. A cylinder can be cut and unrolled into a rectangle and the surface area of this rectangle is the product of its height and the perimeter of the circle $2\\pi x_1 x_2$. The sum of the cylinder's two flat circular caps is $2\\pi x_1^2$. The total surface area of the cylinder with flat circular ends is then $2\\pi x_1^2 + 2\\pi x_1 x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three functions can be made from the above information: the one describing the volume of the cylinder, the other telling the surface area and the last measuring the height difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the problem is:\n",
    "\n",
    "maximize Volume = $\\pi x_1^2  x_2$  \n",
    "minimize SurfaceArea = $2\\pi x_1^2 + 2\\pi x_1 x_2$  \n",
    "minimize HeightDiff = $|x2-15.0|$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the cylinder's height must be greater or equal to its width. This information gives us the following constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "$g(x) = 2x_1 - x_2 \\leq 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this example, you need to run each individual code block (the ones saying `In [ ]:` to their left) by clicking on each one and then clicking \"Run\". Please refer to the [background section of the documentation](http://desdeo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/background/index.html) for information about NIMBUS.\n",
